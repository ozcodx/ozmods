# **Exile Modpack by Oz**  
Collection of mods created by Oz to improve, enhance and personalize the game experience

## **About This Modpack**  
This modpack is my personal collection of modifications and additions tailored specifically for *Exile*, a survival game built using the Luanti (formerly Minetest) engine. My goal is to enhance the core gameplay experience while maintaining the original survival essence. Each mod within this pack is a reflection of my vision to make *Exile* more immersive, challenging, and enjoyable.

## **Why I Built This**  
Survival games thrive on creativity and adaptability. While *Exile* offers a strong foundation, I wanted to make it even more engaging by customizing mechanics and adding new layers of depth. This project is both a creative outlet and a way to explore the flexibility of the Luanti engine, refining *Exile* to better suit my personal taste and gameplay style.  

## **Ideas for Future Mods**  
This modpack is a work in progress, and I have many ideas I’d like to explore in future updates:  

- **Advanced Ceramics**: New pottery mechanics with functional and decorative uses.  
- **Composter**: A composting system for organic waste to enrich farming.  
- **Idol Worshipping with Blessings and Curses**: Introduce idols that provide blessings… or curses, depending on how you interact with them.  
- **Sundials**: A simple and immersive way to track time in the world.  
- **Fermentation**: Systems for creating fermented goods like alcohol or preserved food.  
- **Alchemy**: Unlock new crafting mechanics with magical or chemical twists.  
- **Bonemeal on the Grindstone**: A functional addition for grinding bones into useful materials.  

These are just a few of the concepts I’m currently exploring. I aim to implement them in ways that feel meaningful and balanced within the game.

## **Installation**
If you want to include instructions later, add them here. For example:  

1. Ensure you have the latest version of *Exile* and Luanti installed.  
2. Download the modpack files.  
3. Extract the contents into your game’s `mods/` directory.  
4. Enable the mods from the game’s settings menu.  

## **Individual Mod Details**  
Each mod included in this pack has its own README file with detailed descriptions and instructions. If you’re curious about a specific feature, check the corresponding documentation.  

## **Final Thoughts**  
This project is fueled by passion for survival games and open-source engines like Luanti. I’m excited to continue experimenting and expanding on *Exile*. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
